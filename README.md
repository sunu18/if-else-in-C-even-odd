The if else statement in C is a conditional statement that allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on a particular condition.

The syntax of if else statement consists of the if keyword followed by a boolean expression inside the parentheses, and the code to be executed if the condition is true inside the curly braces. The else keyword is then followed by the code to be executed if the condition is false, also enclosed within curly braces.

When the program executes an if else statement, it evaluates the boolean expression inside the parentheses. If the expression evaluates to true, the code inside the if block is executed. Otherwise, the code inside the else block is executed.

A common example of an if else statement in C is to check if a number is even or odd. In this case, the boolean expression inside the if statement would check if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to zero. If it is, then the number is even, and the program executes the code inside the if block. If the remainder is not equal to zero, then the number is odd, and the program executes the code inside the else block.

In summary, the if else statement is a fundamental control structure in C programming that allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on a particular condition.
